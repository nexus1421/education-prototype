    <h2>Detected Parts:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🌿 Leaf → The leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs, containing chloroplasts that capture sunlight and convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. They have a broad, flat surface to maximize light absorption and contain stomata (tiny pores) for gas exchange. The leaves shown appear to have the typical angiosperm structure with visible veining.</li>

	<li>🍎 Fruit → The fruits (shown as red spherical structures) develop from the flower's ovary after fertilization. They protect the developing seeds and aid in seed dispersal. The red coloration suggests these fruits may be designed to attract animals for seed dispersal.<li>
This represents a complete angiosperm with all major organ systems working together - roots for absorption and anchorage, stems for transport and support, leaves for photosynthesis, and reproductive structures (flowers and fruits) for continuation of the species.<li>
     
      <li>🌸 Flower → The flowers are the reproductive structures unique to angiosperms. They contain male parts (stamens with pollen-producing anthers) and/or female parts (pistils with ovaries). The white flowers in this diagram would attract pollinators and facilitate sexual reproduction.</li>

	<li>🌱 Stem → The stem serves as the plant's structural backbone, providing support for leaves, flowers, and fruits. It contains vascular tissues (xylem and phloem) that transport water, nutrients, and sugars throughout the plant. Stems also position leaves optimally for photosynthesis and flowers for reproduction.</li>

	<li>🫚 Roots → The roots are the underground portion that anchors the plant and absorbs water and nutrients from the soil. They also store energy and can produce hormones. The branching network shown here is typical of a fibrous root system, which maximizes surface area for absorption.
    </ul>
